This project implements a combinational logic decoder that converts a 3-bit binary input (d2, d1, d0) into the corresponding pattern on a 7-segment LED display on the Basys3 FPGA board. 

This project demonstrates fundamental digital logic design concepts including: 
- Boolean algebra & minimization
- Truth table to logic equation conversion
- Combinational logic design
- Seven-segment display control
- Handling active-low signals on FPGA boards
