# Verilog-Based-FPGA-Systems-Digital-Logic-Designs
A series of FPGA design projects exploring digital circuits, synchronous logic, timing control, state machines, and hardware interfacing. Implemented in Verilog and simulated/synthesized using Vivado for the Basys3 development board. Includes finite state machines, LED drivers, LFSR-based random generators, counters, multiplexers, and more.
